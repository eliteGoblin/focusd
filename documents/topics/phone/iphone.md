Why need signout of iphone's appleID? Screetime, if have appleID signed in, can easily bypassed using unlock password. 

To fix the message: "cannot signout due to restrictions", it's almost always because screentime password is set. 

* Screen time, change passcode
* Turn of passcode

Then optionally restart iphone, then iphone can be signedout.
