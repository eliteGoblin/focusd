# FocusD - Freedom from Distraction

> Breaking free from the slot machines in our pockets.

## Philosophy

Phones and websites are designed like slot machines - engineered to capture attention and create anxiety. They harm our ability to focus deeply and damage intimate relationships. This toolset helps reclaim control.

## Chrome Focus

**Status:** Production-ready | **Version:** 0.1.0

A self-enforcing Chrome extension manager that prevents disabling productivity extensions.

**Key Features:**
- Force-installs Chrome extensions via enterprise policies
- Auto-restores policy if deleted (background daemon)
- Motivational barriers to prevent impulsive disabling
- Temporary disable with auto-re-enable (max 1 hour)
- Process name obfuscation for self-protection

**Quick Start:**

cd chrome
./install.sh
sudo cf on
```

## Why These Tools Exist

Modern technology companies use psychological manipulation to maximize engagement:

- **Variable rewards** (like slot machines) keep us checking notifications
- **Infinite scroll** removes natural stopping points
- **FOMO mechanics** create anxiety about missing content
- **Social validation** (likes, views) triggers dopamine loops

**Consequences:**
- Inability to focus on deep work
- Increased anxiety and stress
- Damaged personal relationships
- Loss of autonomy and self-control

These tools are designed to help you **opt out** of that system.
