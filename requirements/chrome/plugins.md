I have a list of chrome plugin,  e.g chrome://extensions/?id=cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb, I want to enforece it , so I cannot disable it in chrome.

Help me build automation, so everytime just "OneClick" it will ensure all plugin enforced

Note

* Im not using Google workspace, so local chrome setting enfored is good enough

# Target System

* First start with Ubuntu(my current using 24.04), then ideally support Macos. i.e Solution better cross platform

# Daemon

* Ideally I need somthing a script says: "on", it will run and sync everything.
* Sometimes I tempted to just remove the plugin or delete the Chrome management JSON file locally, and watch youtube. I need to make it harder. I need: If I need to say: chrome_focus off, I need to be prompted a long string , contain some motivation words(ideally pulling from internet randomly), so I need to type them before I confirm I want to quit. make it long enough so I just won't temped to just block
* Add off just for certain period, then after it , will auto on (so default is on), first time I say "on", there should be a daemon like to watch behaviour:
    * If I delete the file of chrome management, it will auto create
    * The daemon's process name should be hard to guess and look like a legitimate system process (use `setproctitle` to disguise as system daemons like systemd-*, gvfs-*, dbus-*, etc.)
    * Process name should be randomized on each start to prevent pattern recognition
    * Do not reveal PID or process details in output to prevent easy termination

## CLI

       - on - Enable enforcement + start obfuscated daemon
       - off --duration <minutes> - Temporary disable with auto-enable Prompt with motivational quote to type before disabling
       - status - Check if daemon is running (make sure daemon name I cannot simply get by reading code, maybe dynamic? but not sure how this will let you read status)

Note:
* Every off neeed motivation and max disable is 1 hour. 




# Output

* Write code inside chrome folder
* Ideally use Nodejs/JS, with moedern setup like TS. but this is optionally. Use Python if you think better use python. or you recommend solution that's runnable both on Mac and Ubuntu. After suggeston with AI, use Python

# List of plugins


* Freedom chrome://extensions/?id=abdkjmofmjelgafcdffaimhgdgpagmop
* chrome://extensions/?id=cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb
* chrome://extensions/?id=gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom
* chrome://extensions/?id=nfghbmabdoakhobmimnjkamfdnpfammn
* chrome://extensions/?id=khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid

Note:
* I need you to create yaml to store the chrome plugin, not hardcode in code
* plugins.yml contain link and name and descriptions (name I want you to grab it from internet if can)

# Python

* Use poetry to manage dependency, use venv for this project. make sure not install package globally

# CLI Wrapper

* Create wrapper script `cf` to simplify command usage
* Install to `/usr/local/bin/cf` (system bin directory, in sudo's PATH)
* Cross-platform: works on both Ubuntu and macOS
* Provide `install.sh` script for one-command setup
* Usage: `cf status`, `sudo cf on`, `sudo cf off` (instead of long poetry command)
* Wrapper detects real user even when run with sudo (uses $SUDO_USER)

# Other

* Create concise README.md, for me to understand how to run it
* Add document/design in chrome folder, add all your design thought and other context. and mention all context file in CLAUDE.md: all requirement doc, and design. so you next time I start claude on this project, you know all the context


# Appendix

## Node vs Python 

Python - Recommended

  Pros:
  - Better for system administration tasks (file monitoring, daemon management)
  - Excellent cross-platform file operations with pathlib and shutil
  - Easy binary packaging with PyInstaller (works well on both Ubuntu and macOS)
  - Strong daemon/service management libraries (python-daemon, systemd integration)
  - File watching with watchdog library is robust and cross-platform
  - Process management with psutil for checking running daemons
  - Simple HTTP requests for fetching motivational quotes

  Cons:
  - Slightly larger binary size
  - Not as "modern" feel as TypeScript

  Node.js/TypeScript

  Pros:
  - Modern development experience with TypeScript
  - Great async/await for file watching with chokidar
  - Rich CLI libraries (commander, inquirer for interactive prompts)
  - Fast startup times
  - Easy API calls for motivational quotes

  Cons:
  - System-level operations (daemon management, service creation) are more complex
  - Cross-platform binary packaging (pkg, nexe) can be finicky
  - Chrome policy paths differ significantly between OS - requires more conditional logic
  - File watching on macOS sometimes requires native modules

  My Recommendation: Python

  For this use case, Python is better because:
  1. Chrome policy management requires root/admin privileges and specific system paths - Python handles this more reliably
  2. Daemon creation and management is more mature (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS)
  3. File watching/auto-recreation is straightforward with watchdog
  4. Single binary deployment works well with PyInstaller on both platforms
  5. Your requirement mentions making the daemon "hard to guess" - Python's packaging with obfuscated names works great

  Would you like me to proceed with Python, or do you prefer TypeScript/Node.js?
